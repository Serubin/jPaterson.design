	  <p>
	      This animation project was done for the UC Berkeley 3D Modeling and Animation class.
	      Our goal was to follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16dAV1d5gqnWyYIijCpZ4bFVC49bRImPjhEtz-8dOXvE/edit#slide=id.g16b4431faa_0_35">storyboard</a> created by our director. I was the work manager for our group.

	      The work went smoothly at first, but as the semester continued, several group members
	      began to miss class and work deadlines. The rest of the group became discouraged by our
	      lack of progress. Towards the end of the semester, I called together most of our group members
	      for several large work sessions in which we managed to catch up. I became much closer to the
	      other group members through these work sessions. At this point, the tide began to turn and there
	    	was a feeling that we would manage to complete the project.
	  </p>

	      On the night before the animation showings, I spent the night in the lab compiling and rendering
	      all of the group member work and completing all post production editing. In the middle of the night,
	      the rendering servers broke down. I didn't want to see all the work put in by my group members go to
	      waste, so I went through and screen recorded each scene into 'playblasts' through Maya. One hour before
	      the showing, the rendering servers came back online and I rushed to replace all my playblasts with r
	      endered versions. The finished product is a bit rough, but I'm proud that we managed to complete it.
