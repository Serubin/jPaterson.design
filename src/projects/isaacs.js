      The goal of this research project was to create an interface for controlling drones through the Microsoft Hololens. I joined the controls team of the project during my sophomore year at UC Berkeley. Our project was selected as one of the Award Recipients for the first Microsoft Hololens Academic Research Grants. For a while our team didn't have access to the Hololens, so we worked on ways of controlling the drones using existing controller free systems like the Leap Motion or Mio. When we received the Hololens, we learned that the primary system of interaction was through a series of airtaps, not at all the fluid hand gestures and tracking we had hoped for. The headset's connection latency would also be far too great to allow for direct control of the drone. The project was off to a rough start.

      We needed information on how to create a useful platform for users. On the design team, I conducted a user research study in which I ran several interviews with members of the UAVs at Berkeley club. I used the data gathered to identify several areas in which an Augmented Reality interface would be useful for drone users. Based on these applications and taking into account latency limitations, I designed a framework for the interface. This framework would include a bounding box the the drone would be locked inside by GPS in case of connection loss, the ability to set camera angle and a path through nodes that could be moved through 3d space and angled similar to a BÃ©zier curve. We put this plan into motion and prototyped a Unity application over the next few months.

      After completing a Minimal Viable Product for the interface, the pressure came on for our SLAM team, the group responsible for creating a method of mapping the terrain the drone and giving it a relative location to its environment. Several graduate students joined the project and we worked closely with them to test various approaches with a motion capture system.

      As I approached my senior year, ISAACS splintered into several different research groups and I led one of these new directions for the project. I spearheaded the interface development for a grant the Center of Augmented Cogntion had received to create a
      <a href="https://github.com/j-paterson/ImmersiveDroneInterface">Virtual Reality interface for 3d mapping cities with drones</a>. In Spring 2017, I ran another user research study on the Hololens prototype, and identified a number of UX improvements to be included in the VR interface.
        I worked over the summer with an intern and created a prototype for the new interface. In the fall I recruited and trained several team members to help implementing my design changes. This new interface reduced path creation and adjustment task time by 20%, reduced depth perception errors and was found by all users to be more intuitive. Upon completion of the interface, I built a Robotic Operating System API to stream data between Unity and the Motion Capture System that we use as a server for communication between the drone and a computer. This data is also used for predictive analytics, displaying the intended approach of the <a href="https://github.com/HJReachability/meta_fastrack/tree/vr2">semi-autonomous obstacle avoidant controls system</a>.

      This interface was also built to be an open source platform for future research, with transparent code architecture and documentation to enable large scale collaboration.
      To facilitate open source use of the platform, I rearchitected the entire platform after we had implemented a majority of the final interactions in order to create a more efficient, intuitive and well documented code base.
      I am currently running a final round of user testing and will conclude with writing a UX Research paper comparing the immersive interface to more traditional interfaces will be published in 2018.
