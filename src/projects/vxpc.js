          In 2016, I oversaw logistics and all web and print design for the <a href="https://vr.berkeley.edu/vxpc/public/">Virtual Experience Convention, Berkeleyâ€™s first AR/VR Convention</a>, attracting over 300 attendants.
          I worked alongside our Industrial Relations and Marketing teams to coordinate the event.
          The following year, I coordinated the entire 2017 Virtual Experience Convention, managing all teams, sponsorships, speakers and details.

	    <p>
	        The goal of the Virtual Experience Convention was to connect industry leaders to young enthusiasts and
          entrepreneurs. The event provided attendees with an opportunity to experience the latest VR/AR products, hear
          from industry leaders, and network with like-minded individuals.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Logistics continued to change and shift right up until the morning of the event, which made keeping the schedule up to date
          quite challenging. I filled many roles throughout the day to keep the event rolling smoothly and direct
          our volunteers.
