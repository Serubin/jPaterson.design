      I've made several iterations of this website. Each time I've made use of new skills to make the site more responsive
      and user friendly. The current site employs a number of micro animations and is built using a React Router to provide silky smooth transitions.
      Everything was built for a clean mobile experience and has been tested on a variety of browsers and screen sizes. I really enjoyed working with React on this project
      and I look forward to working with it more in the future.
