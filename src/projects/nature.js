    <p>
      I have worked on a number of aspects of this website and many others in the
      College of Natural Resources since I joined the CNR Web Team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally, my assignments consisted of moving and redesigning massive quantities of content and users
      from an older site to this one. I gradually learned the ins and outs of the drupal system and handled
      requests for content changes. A lot of running this website has been identifying what aspects can be
      automated to reduce work by hand. I learned to create modular pages that self populate with pieces of
      content from around the site to create comprehensive compilations that require no manual updating. I also
      learned to carefully run batch processes to adjust design on a large number of content items at once.
